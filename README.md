## TCPConn


</div>

### Description

This application will allow you to connect to any listening computers IP Address and port number (such as a Web Server/MUD/Router - Anything really!) and allow you to directly communicate to it and view it's output. I use it to control any TCPIP Programmes I develop, so that I don't have to use the client I wrote, but I can use this on ALL my TCPIP Applications. <<< PLEASE VOTE IF YOU LIKE THIS CODE >>>
 
### More Info
 
Just the basics, IP Address and port number and the text/s you wish to send.

I have commented all aspects, but have included only TCP error trapping - No user errors have been trapped.

Any data the server sends back to you.
